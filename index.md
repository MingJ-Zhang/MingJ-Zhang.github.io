## Hi there 👋

I am a Ph.D. student at **Beijing University of Technology (BJUT)** 🎓.  
My research mainly focuses on **Deep Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence**, especially in the following areas:

- 🖼️ **Image Enhancement & Restoration** (denoising, low-light enhancement, super-resolution)  
- 📉 **Time Series Analysis & Forecasting** (deep learning-based methods for complex temporal patterns)  
- 🤖 **General AI Techniques** (representation learning, generative models, multimodal learning)  

---

### 🔭 Current Research
- Exploring frequency-domain and spatial-domain hybrid methods for image enhancement  
- Developing robust models for noisy and corrupted image restoration  
- Studying deep architectures for time series forecasting and anomaly detection  

---

### 🌱 About Me
- 💡 Passionate about solving real-world problems with AI  
- 📚 Enthusiastic about academic research and open-source contributions  
- 🏫 Currently working on projects related to **image quality improvement** and **long-term sequence modeling**
